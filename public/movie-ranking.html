<hr />

<h3>1. The Lord of The Rings: The Two Towers</h3>
<p>This is the second film in a trilogy, but there are powerful moments, incredible scenery, and intense action that make this worth a watch.</p>

<h3>2. Fantastic Mr. Fox</h3>
<p>Beautiful colors, charming animation, and based on a children's novel by the brilliant Roald Dahl.</p>

<h3>3. The Princess Bride</h3>
<p>A classic adventure film. Daring fights, true love, solid comedy. What's not to like?</p>
