<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Education and Professional Experience</h2>
<p>I have a Bachelor's degree in Linguistics from the University of Utah, and am currently pursuing a Master's of Science in Information Systems. I plan to move into software engineering after graduation. 
  I have worked in the translation industry as a translation coordinator for French and German, as an international benefits analyst in the benefits administration industry, and, most recently, as a business systems analyst in the benefits administration industry.

<h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
<p>My hobbies and interests have varied over the years, but currently they revolve around spending time with my wife and our 4 children, studying a variety of languages, long-distance running, and bird watching. 
  The latter three happen when I have time, or if I'm lucky they happen with my wife and children.
I currently speak Russian at an intermediate level, German and Norwegian at a basic conversational level, and a smattering of Spanish and French. I have also dabbled in Arabic, Polish, Japanese, and Finnish, among other languages.
